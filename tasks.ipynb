    "A Turing machine is a simple, abstract computational model introduced by Alan Turing in 1936. It consists of:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **An infinite tape** divided into discrete cells, each of which can hold a symbol from a finite alphabet (e.g., `0`, `1`, and a blank symbol `_`).\n",
    "2. **A tape head** that can read the symbol in the current cell, write a new symbol in that cell, and move one cell left or right.\n",
    "3. **A finite set of states**, including a designated start state and one or more halting (accept/reject) states.\n",
    "4. **A transition function** that, based on the current state and the symbol under the head, specifies:\n",
    "   - Which symbol to write,\n",
    "   - Which direction to move the head (left or right),\n",
    "   - Which state to transition into next.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its simplicity, the Turing machine is powerful enough to model any computation that can be performed by modern computers. It serves as the foundation for the theory of computation and the concept of algorithmic decidability.\n",
